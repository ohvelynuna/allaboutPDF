### how to install poppler

Go to https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases and download the binary of your choice. In this example we will download and use poppler-0.68.0_x86.

Extract the archive file poppler-0.68.0_x86.7z into C:\Program Files. Thus, the directory structure should look something like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81dc2c1e-8293-4ae0-b961-dc31e5c0dcb6)

Add C:\Program Files\poppler-0.68.0_x86\bin to your system PATH by doing the following: Click on the Windows start button, search for Edit the system environment variables, click on Environment Variables..., under System variables, look for and double-click on PATH, click on New, then add C:\Users\Program Files\poppler-0.68.0_x86\bin, click OK.

If you are using a terminal to execute poppler (e.g. running pdf2image in command line), you may need to reopen your terminal for poppler to work.
